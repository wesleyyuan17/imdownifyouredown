## Description

This repo is the source code for a web-app for hosting events that allows attendees to anonymously flake. So often, everyone going to an event wants to ditch but no one wants to be the first to suggest canceling, leading to negative utility for all involved. Now there's a way to see if everyone's on the same page without any individual seeming like a flake!

## Install

Make sure you are using Python 3.11. Set up your environment by running

```[bash]
./init.sh
```

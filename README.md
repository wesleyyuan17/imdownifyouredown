# imdownifyouredown

## Description

This repo is the source code for a web-app for hosting events that allows attendees to anonymously flake. So often, everyone going to an event wants to ditch but no one wants to be the first to suggest canceling, leading to negative utility for all involved. Now there's a way to see if everyone's on the same page without any individual seeming like a flake!

## Install

Make sure you are using Python 3.11. Set up your environment by running

```[bash]
./init.sh
```

## Running local dev server

Install `node.js` from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Then navigate to `imdownifyouredown/imdownifyouredown/frontend/app/` and run

```[bash]
npm install
npm start
```

This should automatically start a dev server and open a browser tab to `http://localhost:3000` where the app is loaded.

## Notes

UI is absolutely atrocious: lots of work left to be done. Sorry.
